# Installing as a Service #
source: https://github.com/torfsen/python-systemd-tutorial

## Pre-reqs ##
Need python-systemd package
* `sudo apt-get install python3-systemd`
* or `pip install systemd-python`

Need to create a config file `/etc/mpp-solar/mpp-solar.conf`
* Use the example [mpp-solar example](service/mpp-solar.conf.example) as a start

[see here for examples](configfile.md#Config-file-examples)

## Add mpp-solar service ##
* Create a unit file `/etc/systemd/user/mpp-solar.service`
  * copy [mpp-solar](service/mpp-solar.service) to `/etc/systemd/user/mpp-solar.service`
* Check the service exists
`systemctl --user list-unit-files|grep mpp-solar`
```
mpp-solar.service              disabled
```
* Start the service
`systemctl --user start mpp-solar`

* Check service status
`systemctl --user status mpp-solar`
```

```

* Stopping the service
`systemctl --user stop mpp-solar`

* Restart the service - for example after a config file change
`systemctl --user restart mpp-solar`

Logs and service output
* The output should show up in systemd's logs, which by default are redirected to syslog:
`grep 'mppsolar' /var/log/syslog`
```

```

* Another way to display the service's output is via
`journalctl --user-unit mpp-solar`

## Automatically Starting the Service during Boot ##
```
systemctl --user enable mpp-solar
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

* To disable autostart, simply disable your service:
`systemctl --user disable mpp-solar`

Note that simply enabling a service does not start it, but only activates autostart during boot-up. Similarly, disabling a service doesn't stop it, but only deactivates autostart during boot-up. If you want to start/stop the service immediately then you still need to do that manually

To check whether your service is enabled, use

`systemctl --user list-unit-files | grep mpp-solar`
```
mpp-solar.service              enabled
```

# Creating a System Service #
Once you have a working user service you can turn it into a system service. Remember, however, that system services run in the system's central systemd instance and have a greater potential for disturbing your system's stability or security when not implemented correctly. In many cases, this step isn't really necessary and a user service will do just fine.

## Stopping and Disabling the User Service ##
Before turning our service into a system service let's make sure that its stopped and disabled. Otherwise we might end up with both a user service and a system service.
```
$ systemctl --user stop mpp-solar
$ systemctl --user disable mpp-solar
```
## Moving the Unit File ##
/etc/systemd/user/mpp-solar.service
Previously, we stored our unit file in a directory appropriate for user services (`/etc/systemd/user/mpp-solar.service`). As with user unit files, systemd looks into more than one directory for system unit files. We'll be using `/etc/systemd/system/mpp-solar.service`, so move your unit file there and make sure that it has the right permissions
```
$ sudo mv /etc/systemd/user/mpp-solar.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/mpp-solar.service
$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/mpp-solar.service
```
Our service is now a system service! This also means that instead of using `systemctl --user ...` we will now use `systemctl ...` (without the `--user` option) instead (or `sudo systemctl ...` if we're modifying something). For example:
```
$ systemctl list-unit-files | grep mpp-solar
python_demo_service.service                disabled
```
Similarly, use `journalctl --unit mpp-solar` to display the system service's logs.
